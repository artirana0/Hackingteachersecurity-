This project titled “Hacking Teacher Security Solutions on Implementing a Secure Network” explores a comprehensive approach to identifying, analyzing, and mitigating vulnerabilities in school or college network infrastructures. The objective is to simulate ethical hacking techniques to uncover common security flaws and propose robust, real-time solutions to fortify the network against unauthorized access, data breaches, and internal threats.
The project employs a layered defense strategy by incorporating firewall configuration, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS), secure access controls, and network segmentation.
